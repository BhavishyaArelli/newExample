                        Each portrayal was followed by a hymn led by seventh graders Cassidy Spire and Tori Allen or a piano instrumental. Nielson
                        said her students have become familiar with the Stations of the Cross throughout their years at St.
                        Gregory’s, but that they take extra time to focus and reflect on them before the reenactment. “Anytime
                        we can step out of the desks and outside the classroom we do,” Nielson said. “The more we can act
                        out, the more the students will remember and understand the significance of it.” The traditional
                        Stations of the Cross include 14 events ending with Jesus’ body being sealed in the tomb. However,
                        a 15th station is sometimes added, the Resurrection on Easter morning. “(Holy Week) is the darkest
                        time in our liturgical year,” Nielson said. “The students understand that and take it seriously.”
                        The Last Supper reenactment took place on Holy Thursday, which is also called Maundy Thursday. “Maundy”
                        comes from the Latin word “mandatum” which means “mandate” or “commandment.” It refers to Christ’s
                        commandment to his disciples to show love for one another as he showed them love through his sacrificial
                        death.
