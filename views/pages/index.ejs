  Creator God, Life is Your gift to us. Through Baptism, You invite us to share the gift of our life in service to others. Be with us as we choose, each day, to show Your Presence in “every little way” in our world. Give us the courage and generosity to respond to Your love, to Your call, to Your Will. We pray especially for those who serve You in ministry at St. Gregory’s Catholic Community and in the heart of Nodaway County. May we bear the “Good News” to those in need. Keep us close to You. Open our minds and hearts that we may accept Christ, who gives us strength and courage, to build the Kingdom of God here in our own neighborhoods. We make this our prayer, through Christ, Our Lord. Amen.

    <p>Hi every one. This is a app that is being demonstrated for the purpose of GDP workshop for server management.</p>
    <a type="button" class="btn btn-lg btn-default" href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-flash"></span> Getting Started with Node</a>

    To deploy your own copy, and learn the fundamentals of the Heroku platform, head over to the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs" class="alert-link">Getting Started with Node on Heroku</a> tutorial.

      <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span> How this sample app works</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>This app was deployed to Heroku, either using Git or by using <a href="https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started">Heroku Button</a> on the repository.</li>

        <li>When Heroku received the source code, it fetched all the dependencies in the <a href="https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started/blob/master/package.json">package.json</a>, creating a deployable slug.</li>
        <li>The platform then spins up a dyno, a lightweight container that provides an isolated environment in which the slug can be mounted and executed.</li>
        <li>You can scale your app, manage it, and deploy over <a href="https://addons.heroku.com/">150 add-on services</a>, from the Dashboard or CLI.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span> Next Steps</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If you are following the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs">Getting Started</a> guide, then please head back to the tutorial and follow the next steps!</li>
        <li>If you deployed this app by deploying the Heroku Button, then in a command line shell, run:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><code>git clone https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started.git</code> - this will create a local copy of the source code for the app</li>
          <li><code>cd node-js-getting-started</code> - change directory into the local source code repository</li>
          <li><code>heroku git:remote -a &lt;your-app-name></code> - associate the Heroku app with the repository</li>
          <li>You'll now be set up to run the app locally, or <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#push-local-changes">deploy changes</a> to Heroku</li>
        </ul>

    Please do work through the Getting Started guide, even if you do know how to build such an application.  The guide covers the basics of working with Heroku, and will familiarize you with all the concepts you need in order to build and deploy your own apps.
